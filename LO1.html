									<p>Before we begin exploring the concepts of programming, 
									you need to understand a few basic things about computers and how they work. </p> <b style="color:tomato">
									<p>The physical devices that a computer is made of are referred to as the computer's hardware. The programs that run on a computer are referred to as software.
									</b></p> 
									Computers can do such a wide variety of things because they can be programmed. This means that computers are not designed to do just one job, but to do any job that their programs tell them to do. A program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.

									<div class="content">
										<strong>
										All </strong> data that is stored in a computer is converted to sequences of 0s and 1s.
										A computer's memory is divided into tiny storage locations known as bytes. <b style="color:tomato"> One byte is only enough memory to store a
										letter of the alphabet or a small number</b>. In order to do anything meaningful,
 										a computer has to have lots of bytes. Most computers today have millions, or even billions, of bytes of memory.

										<strong> A</strong> computer's <b style="color:tomato">CPU can only understand instructions that are written in machine language. </b>
										Because people find it <b style="color:tomato"> very difficult to write entire programs in machine language, </b>
										other <b style="color:tomato"> programming languages have been invented</b>. The CPU is an electronic device that is designed to 
										do specific things. In particular, the CPU is designed to perform operations such as the following:
										
										<p> 
										<br> <strong> - Reading </strong> a piece of data from main memory Adding two numbers
										<br> <strong> - Subtracting </strong> one number from another number Multiplying two numbers
										<br> <strong> - Dividing </strong>one number by another number
										<br> <strong> - Moving </strong> a piece of data from one memory location to another 
										<br> <strong> - Determining </strong> whether one value is equal to another value

								<h2>HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								In the 1950s, a new generation of programming languages known as high-level languages began to appear. A high-level language allows you to create powerful and complex programs without knowing how the CPU works and without writing large numbers of low-level instructions. In addition, most high-level languages use words that are easy to understand. For example, if a programmer were using COBOL (which was one of the early high-level languages created in the 1950s), he or she would write the following instruction to display the message Hello world on the computer screen:
								DISPLAY "Hello world"
								Python is a modern, high-level programming language that we will use in this course. In Python you would display the message Hello world with the following instruction:
								print('Hello world')

										<h3>PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT CYCLE</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										Programs must be carefully designed before they are written. During the design
										process, programmers use tools such as pseudocode and flowcharts to create
										models of programs.

											<h3>DESIGNING A PROGRAM</h3>
											<!-- <p>Aenean ornare velit lacus, ac varius enim ullamcorper eu. Proin aliquam sed facilisis ante interdum congue. Integer mollis, nisl amet convallis, porttitor magna ullamcorper, amet mauris. Ut magna finibus nisi nec lacinia ipsum maximus.</p> -->
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											The process of designing a program is arguably the most important part of the
											cycle. You can think of a program's design as its foundation. If you build a
											house on a poorly constructed foundation, eventually you will find yourself
											doing a lot of work to fix the house! A program's design should be viewed no
											differently. If your program is designed poorly, eventually you will find yourself
											doing a lot of work to fix the program.
											
											<p> The process of designing a program can be summarised in the following two
											steps:	
											<br> 1. Understand the task that the program is to perform.
											<br> 2. Determine the steps that must be taken to perform the task.</p>
										</div>
									</section>

											<h3>PSEUDOCODE</h3>
											<!-- <p>Aenean ornare velit lacus, ac varius enim ullamcorper eu. Proin aliquam sed facilisis ante interdum congue. Integer mollis, nisl amet convallis, porttitor magna ullamcorper, amet mauris. Ut magna finibus nisi nec lacinia ipsum maximus.</p> -->
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											The word “pseudo” means fake, so pseudocode is fake code. It is an informal
											language that has no syntax rules and is not meant to be compiled or executed.
											Instead, programmers use pseudocode to create models, or “mock-ups,” of
											programs. Because programmers don't have to worry about syntax errors while
											writing pseudocode, they can focus all of their attention on the program's design.
											Once a satisfactory design has been created with pseudocode, the pseudocode
											can be translated directly to actual code.

											<h3>FLOWCHART</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											Flowcharting is another tool that programmers use to design programs. A flowchart
											is a diagram that graphically depicts the steps that take place in a
											program.Notice that there are three types of symbols in the flowchart: ovals,
											parallelograms, and a rectangle. Each of these symbols represents a step in the
											program, as described here:
											<p>
											<br> - The ovals, which appear at the top and bottom of the flowchart, are called
											terminal symbols. The Start terminal symbol marks the program's starting point
											and the End terminal symbol marks the program's ending point.
											
											<br> - Parallelograms are used as input symbols and output symbols. They represent
											steps in which the program reads input or displays output.
											
											<br> - Rectangles are used as processing symbols. They represent steps in which the
											program performs some process on data, such as a mathematical calculation.</p>

								<h2>IPO (Input Process Output)</h2>

							<div class="content">
	
								<!-- Section -->
								
						
									<div class="content">

											Computer programs typically perform the following three-step process:

										<br>	1. Input is received.
											
										<br>	2. Some process is performed on the input.
											
										<br>	3. Output is produced.
											
										<p>	Input is any data that the program receives while it is running. One common form
											of input is data that is typed on the keyboard. Once input is received, some
											process, such as a mathematical calculation, is usually performed on it. The results
											of the process are then sent out of the program as output.</p>
